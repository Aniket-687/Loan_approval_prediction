# Loan approval prediction applying machine learning
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval outcomes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing various applicant features (e.g. Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History), we train models to determine whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions while exploring the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

Format: CSV
The dataset contains 13 features : 
1.	**Loan**:	A unique id 
2.	**Gender**:	Gender of the applicant Male/female
3.	**Married**:	Marital Status of the applicant, values will be Yes/ No
4.	**Dependents**:	It tells whether the applicant has any dependents or not.
5.	**Education**:	It will tell us whether the applicant is Graduated or not.
6.	**Self_Employed**:	This defines that the applicant is self-employed i.e. Yes/ No
7.	**ApplicantIncome**:	Applicant income
8.	**CoapplicantIncome**:	Co-applicant income
9.	**LoanAmount**:	Loan amount (in thousands)
10.	**Loan_Amount_Term**:	Terms of loan (in months)
11.	**Credit_History**:	Credit history of individualâ€™s repayment of their debts
12.	**Property_Area**:	Area of property i.e. Rural/Urban/Semi-urban 
13.	**Loan_Status**:	Status of Loan Approved or not i.e. Y- Yes, N-No

## Insights & Findings
1. Most of the rides are booked for business purpose.
2. Most of the people book cabs for Meetings and Meal / Entertain purpose.
3. Most of the cabs are booked in the time duration of 10am-5pm (Afternoon).
4. Most of the cabs booked for the distance of 4-5 miles.
5. Majorly people chooses cabs for the distance of 0-20 miles.
6. For distance more than 20 miles ca
